# Algorithm and Programming - Binus Online Learning

A repository for code and notes from my *Algorithm and Programming* course at BINUS Online Learning. It covers basic algorithms, data structures, and programming exercises using C.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Algorithms**: Examples of sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more.
- **Exercises**: Coding exercises and practice problems for deeper understanding.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithm-and-Programming-BOL.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder to view specific topics and code examples.
3. Compile and run C code using a compiler like `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output && ./output
   ```

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- **C Compiler**: Make sure to have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
- **Text Editor/IDE**: VS Code, CLion, or any code editor of your choice.

## ðŸ“š Purpose
This repository serves as a resource for practicing and revisiting key concepts in algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ“„ License
Feel free to use the code for educational purposes.
